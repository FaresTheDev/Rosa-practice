# Rosa-practice
I made this web following @Julio Codes on YT, while I try for the first time making animations!
It was a bit hard for me to work on this site, I didn't follow every second of the video becouse I wanted to just get ideas, and when I was stuck on something I would
first research and then see the video.
in thins site it was my first time trying animation and media querry!
